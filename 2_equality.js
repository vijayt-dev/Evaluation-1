/*
2. What is difference between == and === with an example?
*/

/*
1) == loose equality it converts the variable values to the same type
before perform comparison.

It converts the "1" to number 
console.log("1" == true) // true

2) === does not do any type conversion it return true both have same type and value

It does not converts the "1" to number
console.log("1" === true) //false
